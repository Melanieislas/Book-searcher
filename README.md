# Book-searcher

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a book search engine which replaces RESTful API with a graphQl API
- This webpage includes a login and signup component, also a booksearch which gets the book info from the new implemented API
- From this project, I learned how to use components of graphQl such as resolvers and typeDefs to define my schemas
